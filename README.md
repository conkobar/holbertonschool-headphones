 ### <center>Description</center> 
 ##### &emsp; In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously. You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. You are not allow to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap), and you are not to use Javascript.
